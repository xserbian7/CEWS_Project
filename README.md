# CEWS_Project
Code for a project to analyze whether Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy payments were actually used to keep employees employed or whether they were used to increase (or not decrease) corporate profits and executive compensation. 
The first step of this project has entailed getting a list of the largest publicly traded Canadian firms, using the ICO database to get a list of their subsidiaries and then checking for these firms in the list of firms that received CEWS.
The next step will involve merging in corporate profit and executive compensation data.
